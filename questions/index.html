    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2 class="question1">
        Question 1:<br>What was the first thing you paid attention to<br> when
      interacting with the experience?
    </h2>
    <!--For some reason, cannot get <p> to get centered with current code, therefore no choice but to use <h3> as base text.-->
    <h3 class="answer1">
      The First thing that caught my eyes was the moving images of loading
      screen, <br>which locked my attention onto the webpage for the upcoming
      contents.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question2">
    Question 2:<br>Spend two minutes with the experience and <br>create a list of
      each of your discrete actions.
    </h2>       
    <!--Used a two-column table for more clear visuals.-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column"></div>
      <ul>
        <p class="columntext">1. Opening the website</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="columntext">3. Watching the video</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="columntext">5. Moving around mouse cursor</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="columntext">7. Scrolling down</p>
        <p></p>
      </ul>

      <!-- Used p with class instead of li to have numbers instead of bullet points for more clear reading direction-->
      <div class="column"></div>
      <ul>
        <p class="columntext">2. Viewing the loading screen</pp>
        <p></p>
        <p class="columntext">4. Reading the text</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="columntext">6. Hovering over buttons</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="columntext">8. Clicking buttons</p>
        <p></p>
      </ul>
    </div>

<!-- Wanted to use table to limit the horizontal word legnth for the texts, but the circular shape made it hard to balance therefore chose to manually create breaks between the texts.-->
    <h2 class="question3">
      Question 3: <br>What part of the experience did you <br>spend the most time
      engaging with?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer3">I've engaged the most with viewing and hovering over different videos of the <br>website, as it was part of the main visual element. </h3>
    <h2 class="question4">
      Question 4: <br>What was the most common action in your <br>two minute interaction
      with the experience?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer4">
    I spent the most time scrolling down through the website and clicking buttons <br>to be directed to another page. 
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question5">
      Question 5: <br>What is your impression of the intended <br>primary goal of the
      interactive experience?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer5">
        The impression I had about the website was that it was designed to act as a<br> digital portfolio.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question6">
      Question 6: <br>How does the interactive experience <br>communicate this primary
      goal?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer6">
        The website was quite successful in communicating its goal as a portfolio. <br>
        Rather than heavily focusing on various types of user interaction, the website<br>
         focused on aligning all contents through one major page, then guided the <br>
         viewer through the uniquely designed scrolling path, which seemed as if <br>I was viewing a slideshow.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question7">
      Question 7: <br>What is your impression of how the <br>experience should be interacted with
      over time? <br>(For how long and how many different times)
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer7">
        I believe the scrolling feature of the main website was designed to be <br>
        experienced once as it creates a one-way linear path for the user to interact, <br>
        however, the webpage itself is designed to be accessed multiple times, as <br>
        the contents have their individual page which links back to the main <br>website.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question8">
      Question 8: <br>How does the interactive experience <br>
      communicate how it should be interacted with <br>over time?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer8">
        The interactive experience communicates that the webpage should be viewed <br>
        as an interactive presentation, with the user following the singular main path <br>
        while accessing the contents along the way, which displays more detailed <br>information.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question9">
      Question 9: <br>What other media forms (digital or otherwise)<br> does the
      experience reference?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer9">
        The experience references a portfolio, a presentation, a video and a notepad.
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Portfolio - The website's purpose is to act as a portfolio, showcasing the creator's <br>work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Presentation - The website structure is designed like a presentation, with one <br>path guiding the user's experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Video - There are many aspects of the website which contain and involve <br>video, such as the background and the presenting media.
            </li>
            <li>
                Notepad - The visuals of the website is designed in a whiteboard-like <br>style with the cursor resembling a pen used for digital notes.
            </li>
        </ul> 
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question10">
      Question 10: <br>What does this reference/s communicate to <br> 
      you about how you should act when engaging <br>   with your research experience?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer10">
        This reference communicates to me that I should set my focus on watching<br>
        the displayed videos rather than focusing on the text of the website. 
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question11">
        Question 11: <br> What does this reference/s communicate to you <br>about how you should feel when engaging with <br>your research experience?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer11">
        The website's references communicate that users should feel experimental<br> when interacting with it as it has a large number of principles which can be<br> moved and redirected. 
    </h3>
    <h2 class="question12">
      Question 12: <br>What is the most frustrating part of the <br>interaction to you
      and what makes that part<br> frustrating?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer12">
        The most frustrating aspect of the website is the layout of the content pages and<br> redirection to the main page.
    <br><br>Firstly, the unique scrolling path of the main webpage has a complex movement <br>already, yet the sub content pages share a similar path design, turning the <br>webpage from a path into a maze. 
    <br><br>Secondly, the subpage's scroll bar is located at the bottom, creating an <br>annoying experience for the user, needing to relocate the scroll bar <br>for faster travelling each time they switch between the pages.
    <br><br>Lastly, the redirection button to the previous page is unclear <br>and requires testing clicks, which often directs to <br>irrelevant pages and further confusing    my <br>location within the complex <br>website. 

    </h3>
    <h2 class="question13">
      Question 13: <br>What is the most satisfying part of the <br>interaction to you
      and what makes that part<br> satisfying?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer13">
        The scrolling experience of the homepage and the following animated visuals <br>is the most satisfying part of the interaction. The website uses minimalistic <br>design with white text which directs the user's focus on the subjects with<br> motion. This also gives modern and professional values to the website <br> which is satisfying to view.
