<!-- I've created a separate html for the main function because I wanted to have the index as some kind of opening page. As users will visit this website with a plan to study, click here to get started will act as a trigger for them to be emotionally prepared to study.-->
<!--From the previous assignment I was recommended to use different fonts, but I like the minimalist atmosphere it gives for the current page hence I decided to keep it that way for the main page. While sans-serif is primarily used in menu.html for the same reason, I have made a couple of  variations in some areas..-->
