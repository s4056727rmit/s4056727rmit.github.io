<!-- I've created a separate html for the main function because I wanted to have the index as some kind of opening page. As users will visit this website with a plan to study, click here to get started will act as a trigger for them to be emotionally prepared to study.-->
 <!-- My Original plan was to have a separate html page for each section, including main menu, music player, music playlist, explore page, etc. However, that would've been too complicated and time-consuming to make and it adds unnecessary inconvenience. Most importantly, I wanted to have the nice, smooth scrolling travel experience between the music player and playlist selector and having a separate page would be hard to accomplish that. -->

<!-- My original layout plan for this page was to divide the webpage into two sections: unscrollable fixed music player on top, scrollable menu including playlist, add playlist, explore playlist, playlist of the day features on the bottom.-->
 <!-- However, I could NOT figure out how to lock a certain area of the webpage and nor overflow:hidden or other methods did what I wanted, so I scrapped that idea and just divided the page to 2 fixed sections, one being the music player and the other, playlist manager.-->
  <!-- I wanted the bottom section to be a bit taller than the screen so users can scroll and feel a sense of openess, like a break, but yeah that didn't work out and currently it feels a little confining which I'm a little unsatisfied with.-->
